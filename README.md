# How to Play
The goal is to achive the highest possible score, you gain points by surviving more, gaining speed with your grappling hook and the other parkour mechanics and killing as much enemies as possible. It is an endless runner with a lot of enemies, so you have to be careful and try to survive as much as you can with the weapons given. 

### Weapons
You will be given 2 main weapons:
- **Rifle**: It's the main weapon, it is an auto weapon and it is very powerful. It is the best weapon to kill enemies from a distance.

- **Drone**: It's a drone that flies around the map. It is not very powerful but it is very fast and they spawn in large groups so they are really annoying. If you kill them with your weapon you will receive points. If you kill them by grabbing them and throwing them, you will receive more points for that enemy and also for the rest of the enemies that are in the explosion radius.

### Parkour Mechanics
There are 2 parkour mechanics in the game:
- **Grappling Hook**: You can use the grappling hook to move around the map. You can use it to move faster and to reach places that you can't reach with your normal movement. You can also hook enemies and move along with them.

- **Slide**: You can slide to avoid enemies and to move faster. When you slide throuh a slope you build up momentum and speed. This will make jump much higher allowing you even skip some parts of the map.

- **Wall-Riding (yet to be implemented)**: You can ride walls to move faster and to reach places that you can't reach with your normal movement. You can also ride enemies and move along with them.

### Controls
- **WASD**: Move the character.
- **Left Click**: Shoot with the main weapon.
- **Right Click**: Hold to use the grapple hook.
- **Space**: Jump.
- **Shift**: Sprint.
- **Left Control**: Slide.
- **Mouse Wheel**: Switch weapons.
- **E**: Pick objects.
- **Q**: Throw objects.
- **3**: Switch to Heavy weapon

# Art Style
The art style of the game is very simple, it is a low-poly game. The reason for this is that the game is made for fun and to learn, so we wanted to make a game that was not very demanding in terms of graphics. We also wanted the game to have a futuristic approach, so we added some neon colors to the game, glitch camera effects and tron styled surfaces. Here are some screenshots of the game:
